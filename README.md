# ERA_V1 S7 Assignment
The objective of the assignment is to achieve a validation accuracy of 99.4% on [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset
-  with less than 8K parameters 
-  within 15 epochs.

# File Structure
Intermediate_ipynb - this folder contains all the ipynb files that were tried to arrive at the final model.
The main folder contains the 
-  S7_final_model.ipynb file which is the final  ipynb file
-  model.py which contains all the intermediate model architectures, test_model and train_model.
-  utils.py which contains all the plot functions.
